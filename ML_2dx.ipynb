    "Regularization is a set of techniques used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, a common problem where a model fits \n",
    "the training data too closely and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Regularization methods add constraints or\n",
    "penalties to the model's training process, encouraging it to learn simpler and more generalizable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques work by adding an additional term to the loss function that the model minimizes during training. \n",
    "This additional term penalizes the model for certain behaviors, such as having large parameter values or fitting the training\n",
    "data too closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common regularization techniques and how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 Regularization (Lasso):\n",
    "   - L1 regularization adds the absolute values of the model's coefficients as a penalty term.\n",
    "   - It encourages the model to set some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating \n",
    "    less relevant features.\n",
    "   - This can result in a sparse model where only a subset of features are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "   - L2 regularization adds the squared values of the model's coefficients as a penalty term.\n",
    "   - It encourages the model to have smaller coefficient values, effectively reducing the impact of less important features.\n",
    "   - L2 regularization tends to push the coefficients towards but not exactly to zero, leading to a more balanced impact on \n",
    "     features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "   - Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "   - It provides a balance between feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage (L2), aiming to address the limitations of \n",
    "     both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropout:\n",
    "   - Dropout is commonly used in neural networks.\n",
    "   - During training, random neurons or connections are \"dropped out\" with a certain probability, effectively preventing the\n",
    "     network from relying too heavily on any single neuron.\n",
    "   - Dropout helps to create a more robust and generalized network by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Early Stopping:\n",
    "   - Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training.\n",
    "   - When the validation error stops improving or starts to degrade, training is stopped early.\n",
    "   - This prevents the model from continuing to learn the noise in the training data, which often leads to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Max-Norm Regularization:\n",
    "   - Max-norm regularization constrains the magnitude of weights in a neural network.\n",
    "   - It prevents weights from growing too large, which can help to mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "These regularization techniques add extra terms or constraints to the loss function, nudging the model to balance between \n",
    "fitting the training data and avoiding overfitting. Choosing the right regularization technique and tuning its hyperparameters\n",
    "is crucial to finding the best balance for your specific problem."
